Introduction
The Movie App is a basic React application that allows users to explore a collection of movies. It leverages React Router DOM for navigation, useState and useEffect hooks for state management, the map function to iterate over movie data, and the filter function to search and filter movies based on user input. Flexbox is used for styling the layout, and the app is designed to make use of props to pass data between components.
